# Starter Vert.x Kafka app

A starter app for testing out your [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) deployment and trying out the [Vert.x Kafka client](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-kafka-client/java/).

The app allows you to send records to a topic in Kafka called `demo` every two seconds and consume back those records.

## Running the app

Test out the app by connecting to the websocket endpoints (UI will be added soon!):

 - Make sure Kafka is running locally. (You can use the [quickstart guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart))
 - Build the app: `mvn install`
 - Start the app: `java -jar target/demo-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT-all.jar`
 - Connect to `ws://localhost:8080/demoproduce` (e.g., using [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat))
 - Start sending records to Kafka by sending the following message to the websocket:
    ```
    {"action":"start"}
    ```
    The websocket will receive notifications every time the app sends a new record to Kafka.
 - Stop sending records by sending the following message to the websocket:
    ```
   {"action":"stop"}
   ```
 - Disconnect from the produce websocket
 - Connect to `ws://localhost:8080/democonsume`
 - Start consuming from Kafka by sending the following message to the websocket:
    ```
    {"action":"start"}
    ```
   The websocket will receive information about all the consumed records.
 - Stop consuming records by sending the following message to the websocket:
    ```
   {"action":"stop"}
   ```
 - Disconnect from the consume websocket

## Configuration
To configure the application to connect to your Kafka edit the properties file called `kafka.properties`.
Alternatively you can provide a custom path to the properties file using `-Dproperties_path=<path>` when starting the application.

If your Kafka is secured you will need to enable the security configuration options in your properties file.

To increase the logging level of the application to debug provide a system property at start time: `-Dlog.level=debug`.
To increase the logging level of Kafka client to info provide a system property at start time: `-Dlog.level.kafka=info`.
